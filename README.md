# NoobsImageBuilder
Build a .img file from a NOOBS .zip so you can blow it onto a RaspberryPi using dd.

This tool downloads a specific version of the NOOBS .zip distribution from the RASPI foundation, and creates a small .img file that can be loaded straight onto a factory bought microsd card. It's intended to be used with bulk card programmers, etc.

Built by the beautiful Pacific Ocean in Newcastle, Australia by http://switchdin.com in collaboration with http://core-electronics.com.au.
