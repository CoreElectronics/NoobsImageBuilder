# NoobsImageBuilder
This tool downloads the latest version of the NOOBS distribution from the RASPI foundation, and creates an .img file that can be loaded straight onto a factory-bought microsd card. It's intended to be used with bulk card programmers, etc.

# How to create a NOOBS image
Run the script - the entire process in now automated.

# If you've run this script on a Raspberry Pi
Get the image off the Pi with a flashdrive / shared folder.
If you're using an NTFS formatted flash drive, make sure you execute `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g` otherwise you won't be able to write to the flash drive.
